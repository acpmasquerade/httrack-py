#summary How to install httrack-py as a plugin or Python extension
#labels Featured

Note: The library is strongly recommended to be used with HTTrack version 3.33-beta3 or newer, up to 3.4.0-2. However, HTTrack 3.4.1 and up require httrack-py 0.7 or newer, as httrack-py versions before 0.7 use the older pre-3.4.1 HTTrack API/ABI.

To build the library, you need the httrack sources. Also, you need to run the configure script to generate config.h - if you don't, the compile will not succeed.

The library consists of some C code and a Python wrapper to it. On unix, the package can be built & installed like any other python package (see setup.py for config options prior to this):

{{{
python setup.py build
}}}

and

{{{
python setup.py install
}}}


To compile the code manually, run the compiler as:

{{{
gcc -g -I <path-to-Python-header-files> -I <path-to-httrack-source-dir> \
       -I <httrack-source-dir>/src -lhttrack \
       -l python<version-number> -O -g3 -Wall -D_REENTRANT -DINET6 \
       -D_FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64 -D_LARGEFILE_SOURCE -DPLUGIN \
       -shared -pthread -o httrack-py.so httrack-py.c
}}}

This results in a HTTrack plug-in being built. Copy the resulting httrack-py.so to /usr/local/lib or to some other place in the library search path. To compile as Python extension instead, leave off the "-DPLUGIN" parameter to gcc, and copy the resulting httracklib.so to Python site-packages directory.
