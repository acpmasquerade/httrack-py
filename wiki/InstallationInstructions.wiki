#summary One-sentence summary of this page.

The library consists of some C code and a Python wrapper to it. On unix, the package can be built & installed like any other python packaget; ie. 

{{{
python setup.py build
}}}

and

{{{
python setup.py install
}}}


To compile the code manually, run the compiler as:

{{{
gcc -g -I <path-to-Python-header-files> \
           -I <path-to-httrack-source-dir> \
           -I <httrack-source-dir>/src \
           -l python<version-number> -O -g3 -Wall -D_REENTRANT -DINET6 \
           -D_FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64 -D_LARGEFILE_SOURCE -DPLUGIN \
           -shared -pthread -o httrack-py.so httrack-py.c
}}}

This results in a HTTrack plug-in being built. Copy the resulting httrack-py.so to /usr/local/lib or to some other place in the library search path. To compile as Python extension instead, leave off the "-DPLUGIN" parameter to gcc, and copy the resulting httracklib.so to Python site-packages directory.
